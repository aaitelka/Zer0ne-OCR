# Groq API Keys Configuration
# ===========================
# Add your Groq API keys below, one per line.
# Get your API keys from: https://console.groq.com/keys
#
# The application will rotate through these keys automatically
# to avoid rate limits. More keys = better performance.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to 'api_keys.txt'
# 2. Replace the example keys below with your real Groq API keys
# 3. Never commit api_keys.txt to version control
#
# Format: One API key per line (lines starting with # are ignored)
